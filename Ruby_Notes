Variables:
Local variables, method parameters, and method names should all start with a lowercase letter or with an underscore. 
Global variables are prefixed with a dollar sign ($), while instance variables begin with an ``at'' sign (@). 
Class variables start with two ``at'' signs (@@). 
Finally, class names, module names, and constants should start with an uppercase letter.

Following this initial character, a name can be any combination of letters, digits, and underscores (with the proviso that the character following an @ sign may not be a digit).
